Certainly! Below is an example of a professional README file for your Node.js Express server project. You can customize it with your project-specific information.


# Express Server with HTML to JSON Conversion

A Node.js Express server that serves a static HTML file containing a textarea form. It accepts HTML input from the form, processes the HTML, and converts it into a JSON object using the Cheerio library.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/webguru11124/convert_html_to_json
   
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd demo
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the Express server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

2. Access the web application and enter an HTML string in the textarea.

3. Click the "Submit" button to send the HTML data to the server for conversion.

4. The server will respond with a JSON representation of the HTML structure.

### File Processing (Optional)

To process an HTML file during server startup, you can provide a file name as a command-line argument. For example:

```shell
node index.js input.html
```

The server will read the content of the specified file, convert it to JSON, and display the result in the console.
